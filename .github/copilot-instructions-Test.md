# AI Coding Guidelines for Agentic AI Apps Hackathon

## Project Context
This is a structured hackathon repository for building intelligent applications using Azure OpenAI and Semantic Kernel. The project follows a progressive challenge-based learning approach covering RAG, prompt flow, Semantic Kernel orchestration, and multi-agent systems.

### Challenge-Based Development
- Use MS Docs MCP servers to get information for the challenges
- Each challenge builds incrementally on previous concepts
- Use concise, challenge-based tasks:
	- Write tasks as one-line, high-level objectives (imperative voice), not step-by-step tutorials
	- Avoid prefacing with "Challenge:" — use clear task headings (e.g., "### Task 2: …")
	- Keep 3–5 tasks per challenge; add an optional "Bonus" task when useful
- Maintain the challenge markdown template: Introduction, Concepts (optional), Tasks, Success Criteria, Learning Resources
- Success Criteria: measurable checkbox items matching the tasks (what must be demonstrated)
- Learning Resources: link to official docs (Microsoft Learn, VS Code Copilot, MCP, SDKs, etc.)
- Prefer Azure-first patterns and Semantic Kernel for orchestration; include both C# and Python when practical
- Authoring and formatting rules (to pass markdown linting):
	- Surround headings and lists with blank lines
	- Use ordered lists with consistent `1.` prefixes
	- Avoid bare URLs; use markdown links like `[VS Code Copilot](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview)`
	- Keep lists at consistent indentation levels
