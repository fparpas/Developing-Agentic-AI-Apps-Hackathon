# Challenge 06 Solution - Secure your MCP remote server using an API key

This directory contains the complete solution for Challenge 06, which demonstrates how to secure an MCP server with API key authentication and convert it to a remote web service.

## What's Included

- **SecureWeatherMcpServer/**: Web API version of the Weather MCP Server with API key authentication
- **SecureWeatherMcpClient/**: Updated MCP client that works with the remote secured server

## Solution Overview

This solution demonstrates:

1. **Web API Conversion**: Converting a stdio-based MCP server to a web API
2. **API Key Authentication**: Implementing secure API key-based authentication
3. **Security Headers**: Adding proper security headers and CORS configuration
4. **Admin Endpoints**: Providing API key management functionality
5. **Remote Client**: Updating the MCP client to work with HTTP transport
6. **Security Best Practices**: Following security guidelines for production deployment

## Key Security Features

- **API Key Authentication**: Custom authentication handler for API keys
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All communication encrypted
- **Security Headers**: Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all inputs
- **Audit Logging**: Security event logging
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse
- **Admin Controls**: Secure API key management

## Architecture

```
MCP Client → HTTPS Request → Secure Web API → Weather Tools
           (with API Key)   (Authentication)   (Protected)
```

This solution shows how to take a local MCP server and make it production-ready with proper security controls while maintaining the original functionality.
